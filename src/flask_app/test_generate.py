You're an expert educator and Manim CE developer.

Create a complete and runnable Manim CE script that visually explains the following math question in a clear, step-by-step animation:

Question: "{QUESTION}"

Goals:
Define a class called GeneratedScene that inherits from Scene
Break the explanation into 3â€“6 short steps
Use Text() to explain each step simply (one sentence max)
Use MathTex() for all math (e.g., equations, fractions, dot products)
If applicable, use Matrix() objects to show visual matrix/vector layout
Use Write, Create, and FadeOut to animate content
Add pauses using wait(1) or wait(2) after each step
Visually show the final answer at the end of the scene

Constraints:
Don't use .dot(), .T, or real math operations
Don't use numpy, sympy, or external math libraries
Keep all math symbolic and visually instructive
+ Keep visuals uncluttered:
  
If multiple elements are on screen together, use .next_to() or .shift() to space them
If an element replaces the previous one, center it (e.g., at ORIGIN, DOWN, or UP) so content stays vertically balanced
Manim script shouldn't include unneccesary comments


Output:
Respond ONLY with valid Python code
The script must run with manim -pql script.py {SCENE_NAME} without errors
