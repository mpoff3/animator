# animator

The goal of this project is to creat an way to create math visualizations in Manim using an LLM. The baisc UI will look like thhis:

![docs/ui-mockup.png](docs/ui-mockup-v0.png)

The essential idea of the flow of the system is:

- A user enters a math quetsion in a chat box. To start, we will always default to "How do you multiply a matrix by a vector?"
- The users question is passed to an LLM angent for expansion. The goal of this is to create a text explanation interspersed with animations where appropriate.
- Once this initial text is generated it is passed to a second LLM agent that will create one or more manim scripts. Each script will be posted to a docker container that will generate an mp4 that is dropped onto a bucket.

## Dev setup

```
uv venv --python=3.10
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

You also need latex

### Building and running with docker locally

```
docker build -t mathlens-beta .
```

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 \
  -v $(pwd):/app \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY \
  mathlens
```

TODO -- fix 'xdg-open'issue

## Delploying to GCP

Tag the image for GCR:

```
docker tag mathlens-beta us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/eli5-odewahn-sparktime/llm-experiments/mathlens-beta
```

Push it:

```
docker push us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/eli5-odewahn-sparktime/llm-experiments/mathlens-beta:latest
```

## Calling the function

```javascript
const manimPrompt = `
You're an expert educator and Manim CE developer.

Create a complete and runnable Manim CE script that visually explains the following math question in a clear, step-by-step animation:

Question: "{QUESTION}"

Goals:
Define a class called GeneratedScene that inherits from Scene
Break the explanation into 3â€“6 short steps
Use Text() to explain each step simply (one sentence max)
Use MathTex() for all math (e.g., equations, fractions, dot products)
If applicable, use Matrix() objects to show visual matrix/vector layout
Use Write, Create, and FadeOut to animate content
Add pauses using wait(1) or wait(2) after each step
Visually show the final answer at the end of the scene

Constraints:
Don't use .dot(), .T, or real math operations
Don't use numpy, sympy, or external math libraries
Keep all math symbolic and visually instructive

- Keep visuals uncluttered:

If multiple elements are on screen together, use .next_to() or .shift() to space them
If an element replaces the previous one, center it (e.g., at ORIGIN, DOWN, or UP) so content stays vertically balanced
Manim script shouldn't include unneccesary comments

Output:
Respond ONLY with valid Python code
The script must run with manim -pql script.py {SCENE_NAME} without errors
`;
```

```
    const response = await fetch("https://mathlens-beta-937226988264.us-central1.run.app/generate", {
      method: "POST",
      body: {
        question: "How do you multiply a matrix by a vector?",
        prompt: manimPrompt,
      }
    });
```

    This returns the payload:

```json
    {
        "video_url": video_path,
    }
```
